Colour Solid from Linear Programming
====================================

This example shows how to calculate the colour
solid geometry using a linear programming method.

The linear programming routine is built in to the
ColourSolid object, but it is not used for its
default rendering.

This example also shows how to assign RGB values to spectra.
