                                       The Colour Solid Python Library



About
=====

Lemonsauce is a python 3 package for performing calculations involving
colour solids for arbitrary observers. This is being released in
advanced of a forthcoming paper on animal colouration and colour
perception.

Features
--------

* Get the geometry for colour solids with any dimension
* Plotting tools for matplotlib
* Export tools compatible with 3D rendering tools such as blender.
* Calculation of vividness
* Implementation of related functions
  * Pigment templates
  * Extreme spectra
  * Some human colourmetric functions


Examples
========

The majority of features have examples.
These can be found in the `lemonsauce_examples` directory.
There is also a dedicated README.md explaining them there.

A simple example, however, is displaying a colour solid in 2D:

```python

# Get some example data from the examples package
from examples.fractional_yields import example_fraction_yields

# Import the ColourSolid class
from lemonsauce import ColourSolid

# Create a dicromat ColourSolid
solid = ColourSolid(example_fraction_yields[:, :2])

# Show the solid (`draw_on(<pyplot object>)` can be used too)
solid.draw()
```

Notes
=====

* This library is written to work with numpy. Methods will
often expect to have arrays as input, and generally there is no check that this is so.
